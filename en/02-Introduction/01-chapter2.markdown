## Chapter 2: Introduction

The Developing Adobe ColdFusion 9 Applications guide provides tools for developing Internet applications using
Adobe ColdFusion. The guide is intended for web application programmers who are learning ColdFusion or want to
extend their ColdFusion programming knowledge. It provides a solid grounding in the tools that ColdFusion provides
to develop many different types of web applications of varying complexity.

### Using the Developing ColdFusion Applications guide

The Developing ColdFusion Applications guide includes basic and advanced information on HTML. However, it is
most useful if you have basic ColdFusion experience or have viewed the Getting Started experience, which is available
